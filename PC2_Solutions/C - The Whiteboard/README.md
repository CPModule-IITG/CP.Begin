The question seems pretty good right? Untill you take a look at the constraints....
What would be the time complexity of the intended soln ? Will O(nm) pass?

Noticing this was the whole trick of the question. Once you have noticed, You could just simply go ahead an brute force the whole question.

You need to maximise the sum. So it must be pretty obvious that you will try to replace the minimum element of the original list everytime. This could just be brute
forced.
