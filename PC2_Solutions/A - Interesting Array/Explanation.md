So lets approach the solution step by step. 

What does the RHS in the question mean? isn't it simply max(array)-min(array)?
So essentially we must find the number of such min-max pairs.

Now lets say the array has atleast 2 distinct numbers. Then the no of pairs satisfying the equation will simply be count(max(array)) * count(min(array)) *2 
(We multiply by 2 as we have been asked the number of ordered pairs (i.e) (2,5) and (5,2) are counted seperately.)

Now if there was only one distinct number in the whole array. It is the minimum and the maximum. In this case you have n choices for the first number and n-1 for the second.
Thus the answer in this case is n*(n-1)
