What do we need ? 
maximum even number possible.

When can we make an even number out of the given set of values?
When we have atkeast 2 odd numbers or 2 even numbers.
SO if we have less than 2 odd numbers and less than 2 even numbers, return -1. 

So things must already be clear rightnow. We take the 2 maximum odd numbers and the 2 maximum even numbers from the array (as we know that the maximum even
number will be either the sum of the 2 odd numbers or the sum of 2 even numbers.)

The maximum of sum of both of them will be the answer :)
