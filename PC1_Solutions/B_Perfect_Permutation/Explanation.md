#Perfect Permutation

1. If n is odd, there won't be a solution and we will print -1, try to prove it intuitively on your own :)

2. If n is even, we simply print the pattern 2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 ...

(Assume 1-based indexing)

Now at,
index 1 -> p[p[1]] = p[2] = 1
index 2 -> p[p[2]] = p[1] = 2
index 3 -> p[p[3]] = p[4] = 3 and so on ...

Hence, the property p[p[i]] = i is satisfied for all indexes.
